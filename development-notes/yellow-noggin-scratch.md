###planning
+(1) main page
-teaser list
**title (linking to the page), content or excerpt, date, readme, categories, image
 NOW: get a teaser was going

####development steps4 set up giving the main page going
first goal: main page and better


+ plan first: short-term best method(the shortest method meeting blogger)
- behaviors and features list
- match with how it would be developed


+static first
+ purpose of the project besides gett += the ohing a blog up:
- is static really better?in
- can I use markdown inside the blog content area
** 1 thing on my mind is blog post creation(as far as the written content)
++ is it best practice were(normal in the static blog argument) to think about html when you're running your blog post
- 1 thing I remember about jekyll is that you can style your blog with the most recent blocks and so forth
**categorizing time stamping and being able to blog posts especially titles
++ for example most recent blogs
+this may be the reason why to use firebasein particular



* after: firebase the gallery(similar technique I think the blog that I have)
